        <b>AcademicEssentials</b> was founded in 2023 with a goal of providing affordable and high-quality school supplies to students, teachers 
        and parents across the country. We started with a small inventory of pencils, erasers, and rulers. Rapidly we gained a reputation
        for selling high quality products while providing exceptional customer service. Within the last year we have expanded our 
        product line to include a wider range of school supplies, including notebooks and calculators. As we continue to grow we
        will remain committed to our mission of helping students achieve their academic goals by providing them with the tools they 
        need to succeed. Our commitment to selling high quality products has made us a trusted name in the school 
        supply industry, and we are dedicated to continuing to provide an excellent service for our existing and new customers.
